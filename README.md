# DecodeDSA 🔍✨

**DecodeDSA** is an interactive and visual web application designed to make learning **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** fun, intuitive, and hands-on. It provides step-by-step animated visualizations for core DSA concepts, helping students and developers grasp complex logic through real-time feedback.

## 🧠 What You Can Learn

### 🔢 Sorting Algorithms
- Visualize how data is sorted using:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms
- Understand the step-by-step process of:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search

### 🧱 Stack & Queue
- Push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue operations visualized dynamically.
- Understand LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) vs FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior.

### 🌳 Tree Traversals
- Visualizations of:
  - Inorder Traversal
  - Preorder Traversal
  - Postorder Traversal

### 🔗 Graph Traversals
