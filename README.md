# DecodeDSA 🔍✨

**DecodeDSA** is an interactive and visual web application designed to make learning **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** fun, intuitive, and hands-on. It provides step-by-step animated visualizations for core DSA concepts, helping students and developers grasp complex logic through real-time feedback.
